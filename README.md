# rovercode Marketing Homepage

This is a static web page used as the rovercode marketing landing page deployed at https://rovercode.com .

It is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), though at the moment it is just a single index.html.

For responsiveness, menus, and buttons, it uses [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/).

## Getting the code.

Check out this repo **recursively** like this:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rovercode/rovercode-marketing-page.git
```

## Building
0. Use [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n) to get node version 8.x.

1. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

2. Run `yarn install`.

3. From the directory containing this README, run `hugo serve`.

4. In your browser, go to the `http://localhost:XXXX` address that the output of the `hugo serve` command specifies.

## Editing

Currently, all of the html is in layouts/index.html.

Images should go in static/assets/images.

You can edit the Semantic UI theme at static/semantic/src/themes/rovercode/site.variables. Page-specific changes can be made in the CSS in index.html.
